                        <div class="about-content-description-text">
                            <p><b>&lt;The Meng Family&gt;</b> is the first solo exhibition about pandas by artist <b>Grey</b> (@Panda by Grey, Greyworks) currently based out of Seoul, Republic of Korea, featuring the mother panda Meng Meng and her cubs as the main characters.</p>
                            <p>Although, in general, pandas are separated from their mother and siblings from an early age, luckily Meng Meng and her children all gathered at the Beijing Zoo last fall. This was a very special event for panda fans, including me. I thought it would be a meaningful and happy moment for the Meng family, so decided to leave it as artworks of art to commemorate it. This is why I planned and prepared this exhibition.</p>
                            <p>I designed this special exhibition to aesthetically and symbolically record and memorize the happy moments of the panda family as beautiful artworks. To this end, the artworks were created by combining the existing panda Meng Meng's family and masterpieces that are much loved by people all over the world. It was used the masterpieces of impressionist artists Vincent van Gogh, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne, Oscar-Claude Monet, and Georges-Pierre Seurat who expressed beautiful and intensely colors as the background elements of this work. The images of the Meng family being in harmony each background tell us their warm and touched story.</p>
                            <p>These artworks feature totally six pandas; mother <b>Meng Meng</b>, first <b>Meng Da</b> and his twin brother <b>Meng Er</b>, third <b>Meng Lan</b>, fourth <b>Meng Bao</b> and her twin sister <b>Meng Yu</b>. I reflected their identity by expressing each panda's lovely characters realistically. Because they are so precious just the way they are, I certainly think these artistic records are very meaningful not only panda fans but also our world.</p>
                            <p>Through my artworks, I hope that the loveliness of the pandas, the preciousness of the family, and the happy and warm feelings will be conveyed to many people.</p>

                        This artwork is based on mother Meng Meng as the main character and Vincent van Gogh's masterpiece &lt;Wheat Field with Cypresses (1889)&gt; as a background motif. Lovely Meng Meng looks at us with a sunflower, which is a representative flower in many of Gogh's masterpieces. Her tender smile and beautiful natural scenery make our minds comfortable. Through this artwork, I hope that we can get away from the present for a while and feel peaceful emotions.
